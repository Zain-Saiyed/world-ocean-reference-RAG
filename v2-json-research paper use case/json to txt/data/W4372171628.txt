Closely resemble in general form and structure atoll-reefs -"Width and depth of the lagoon-channels -Breaches through the reef in front of valleys, and generally on the leeward side-Checks to the filling up of the lagoon-channels-Size and constitution of the encircled islands-Number of islands within the same reef-Barrier-reefs of New Caledonia and Australia-Position of the reef relative to the slope of the adjoining land-Probable great thickness of barrier- reefs page 56 to 68 CHAPTER III. FRINGING OR SHORE REEFS.Reefs of Mauritius-Shallow channel within the reef-Its slow filling up-Currents of water formed within it-Upraised reefs -Narrow fringing-reefs in deep seas-Reefs on the coast of E.
