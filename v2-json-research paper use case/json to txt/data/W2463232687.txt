TITLE: Economics of Coastal Erosion and Adaptation to Sea Level Rise
AUTHOR: ['Sathya Gopalakrishnan', 'Craig E. Landry', 'Martin D. Smith', 'John C. Whitehead']
ABSTRACT:
This article provides a review and synthesis of geoeconomic models that are used to analyze coastal erosion management and shoreline change. We outline a generic framework for analyzing risk-mitigating and/or recreation-enhancing policy interventions within a dynamic framework, and we review literature that informs the nature and extent of net benefit flows associated with coastal management. Using stated preference analysis, we present new estimates on household preferences for shoreline erosion management, including costs associated with ecological impacts of management. Lastly, we offer some guidance on directions for future research.
