ABSTRACT:
Significance Global warming is now a well-documented phenomenon that is influencing every aspect of our world, from increased storm intensity to melting of polar ice sheets and rising sea level. The impact of such changes in climate is least known for the deep ocean, which covers over 60% of the earthâ€™s surface. An unprecedented 24-y time series measuring changes in food supply and utilization by benthic communities at 4,000-m depth in the deep northeast Pacific reveal strong connectivity with changing surface ocean conditions, which have broad implications for the global carbon cycle.
