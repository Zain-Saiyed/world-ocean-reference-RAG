TITLE: Accelerating Invasion Rate in a Highly Invaded Estuary
AUTHOR: ['A. N. Cohen', 'James T. Carlton']
ABSTRACT:
Biological invasions are a major global environmental and economic problem. Analysis of the San Francisco Bay and Delta ecosystem revealed a large number of exotic species that dominate many habitats in terms of number of species, number of individuals and biomass, and a high and accelerating rate of invasion. These factors suggest that this may be the most invaded estuary in the world. Possible causes include a large number and variety of transport vectors, a depauperate native biota, and extensive natural and anthropogenic disturbance.
