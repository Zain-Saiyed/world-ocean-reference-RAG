The prolongation of the growing season in this marine area is much stronger than that known from terrestrial areas. The growing season, defined by biomass or chl a thresholds, increased by 125 or 129 d, respectively, and extends recently from February to December. The spring bloom started earlier at a rate of 1.4 d yr-1 and the end of the autumn bloom was delayed by 3.1 d yr-1. The duration of the growing season increased at a rate of 4.5 d yr-1. The earlier start of the growing season was correlated with a slight increase in sunshine duration during spring, whereas the later end of the growing season was correlated with a strong increase in water temperature in autumn. The period with sea surface temperature >10°C shifted towards the end of November. Correlations of the duration of the growing season with the phosphate and nitrate concentrations were probably not causative. The shifts in the spring and autumn blooms led to a prolongation of the summer biomass minimum. The earlier spring bloom was caused, among other factors, by a shift of the biomass maximum of the dominant diatom Skeletonema marinoi from May to February/March. The delay in the autumn bloom was induced by a retardation of dominant dinoflagellates and diatoms, such as Ceratium spp. and Dactyliosolen fragilissimus.
