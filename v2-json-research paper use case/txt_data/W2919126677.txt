TITLE: Scientists Should Disclose Origin in Marine Gene Patents
AUTHOR: ['Robert Blasiak', 'Jean‐Baptiste Jouffray', 'Colette C.C. Wabnitz', 'Henrik Österblom']
ABSTRACT:
Universities are key players in the collection and commercialization of marine genetic resources. We argue that the research community can promote systematic disclosure of sample origin in patents, thereby taking a global responsibility for setting new norms of transparency that would influence ongoing policy processes and improve sharing of benefits.
