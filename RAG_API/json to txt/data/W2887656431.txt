TITLE: Coral colonies in the eastern tropical Pacific: predation by Acanthaster cf. solaris
AUTHOR: ['J. C. Rodríguez-Vilalobos', 'Arturo Ayala‐Bocos']
ABSTRACT:
The crown of thorns (CoTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) have not been reported as an actual threat to reefs in the Gulf of California; however, in the Espiritu Santo Archipelago National Park, we have evidenced massive predation over scleractinian corals. Its abundance is now over outbreaks threshold value and it is higher than historical records
