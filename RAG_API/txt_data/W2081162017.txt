TITLE: THE ACCURACY OF THE WINKLER METHOD FOR DISSOLVED OXYGEN ANALYSIS1
AUTHOR: ['James H. Carpenter']
ABSTRACT:
The potential errors in the various techniques for the Winkler method have been examined and a new technique developed. The accuracy of this technique has been tested by comparison with standards based on dissolving known quantities of oxygen in oxygen‐free water. An accuracy of 0.1% was observed, so the technique appears suitable for oxygen analyses requiring an accuracy of greater than the 3–5% observed with tho common techniques.
