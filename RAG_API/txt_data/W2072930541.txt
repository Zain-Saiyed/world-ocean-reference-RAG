AUTHOR: ['Alex de Sherbinin', 'A. Schiller', 'Alex Pulsipher']
ABSTRACT:
This paper examines the vulnerabilities of three global coastal cities — Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai — to climate hazards. The paper highlights system characteristics that, in unique combinations, create place-based vulnerabilities to climate hazards. It describes these vulnerabilities then discusses the implications of the results for city planners and managers. A concluding section assesses some of the political obstacles to better disaster preparedness.
