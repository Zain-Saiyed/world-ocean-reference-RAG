ABSTRACT:
Conservation groups have called for protective measures in the Sargasso Sea, a region characterized by unique planktonic seaweed communities. To better understand population connectivity and facilitate effective conservation efforts, we assessed slender Sargassum shrimp (Latreutes fucorum) 16S rDNA variation along a 3093-km transect. FST analysis and an analysis of molecular variance indicate a highly dispersive population, suggesting that a network of protected areas may be necessary to protect the Sargassum ecosystem.
