TITLE: Methane in the Deep Blue Sea
AUTHOR: ['Bilal U. Haq']
ABSTRACT:
Natural gas hydrates, which form under moderately high pressures and low temperature conditions in marine sediments and arctic permafrost, are a potential energy source and have also been implicated in past climate change and in massive slumps and slides on continental shelfs in the oceans. Haq (page
 543) discusses recent research into these gas hydrates and outlines future research directions in this interdisciplinary field.
