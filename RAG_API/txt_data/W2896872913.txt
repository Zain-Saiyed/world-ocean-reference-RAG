AUTHOR: ['Santiago García-Rivera', 'José Luis Sánchez-Lizaso', 'Jose María Bellido Millán']
ABSTRACT:
Composition, spatial distribution and temporal evolution of marine litter on the Spanish Mediterranean seafloor were assessed. The data derive from Spanish MEDITS surveys over 11 years and were analysed by GIS. A total amount of 2197.8 kg of litter was collected. Marine litter (by weight) was composed of plastics (29.3%), clinker (28.4%), wood (10.2%), metal (9.7%) and glass (6.2%). Its density varied among Areas (Alboran Sea > Valenciana >Alboran Island > Tramontana). For the last 11 years, the marine litter has remained stable or decreases in some case. The information provided by this study is a useful baseline to study such debris on the Spanish seafloor. The MEDITS survey has proven to be an appropriate monitoring tool, also of use to assess future control measures.
