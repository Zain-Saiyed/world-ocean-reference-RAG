ABSTRACT:
Highly localized concentrations of elasmobranch egg capsules of the deep‐water skate Bathyraja richardsoni were discovered during the first remotely operated vehicle ( ROV ) survey of the Hebrides Terrace Seamount in the Rockall Trough, north‐east Atlantic Ocean. Conductivity–temperature–depth profiling indicated that the eggs were bathed in a specific environmental niche of well‐oxygenated waters between 4·20 and 4·55° C, and salinity 34·95–35·06, on a coarse to fine‐grained sandy seabed on the seamount's eastern flank, whereas a second type of egg capsule (possibly belonging to the skate Dipturus sp.) was recorded exclusively amongst the reef‐building stony coral Solenosmilia variabilis . The depths of both egg‐laying habitats (1489–1580 m) provide a de facto refuge from fisheries mortality for younger life stages of these skates.
