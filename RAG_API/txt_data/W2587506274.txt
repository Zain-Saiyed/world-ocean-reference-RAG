ABSTRACT:
A 4.9 Mkm 2 region of the southwest Pacific Ocean is made up of continental crust.The region has elevated bathymetry relative to surrounding oceanic crust, diverse and silica-rich rocks, and relatively thick and low-velocity crustal structure.Its isolation from Australia and large area support its definition as a continent-Zealandia.Zealandia was formerly part of Gondwana.Today it is 94% submerged, mainly as a result of widespread Late Cretaceous crustal thinning preceding supercontinent breakup and consequent isostatic balance.The identification of Zealandia as a geological continent, rather than a collection of continental islands, fragments, and slices, more correctly represents the geology of this part of Earth.Zealandia provides a fresh context
