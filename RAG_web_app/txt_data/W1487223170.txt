ABSTRACT:
Abstract A large‐scale survey for offshore aggregates is carried out on the northern shelf of the E ast C hina S ea. Results show that most of them are directly exposed in the Y angtze S hoal and the linear sand ridges system at water depths 25–55 m and 60–120 m, respectively. The components of these deposits belong to fine aggregates in terms of the fineness modulus. The potential resources are as high as 147.8 × 10 12 kg for the Y angtze S hoal yet only 36.68 × 10 12 kg for the sand ridges area, respectively. A preliminary feasibility analysis suggests that the Y angtze S hoal is suitable for dredging under the present conditions of technology and economy.
