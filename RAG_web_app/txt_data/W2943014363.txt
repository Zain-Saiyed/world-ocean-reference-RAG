ABSTRACT:
Abstract Environmental DNA (eDNA) research often requires returning to the laboratory for processing, which can delay species identification by weeksâ€“months. Using a portable Oxford Nanopore MinIon sequencer, eDNA from white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) was rapidly identified from seawater samples collected in the high seas where they have historically been identified with biologging datasets. A total of 10 sequencing runs were performed on the MinIon onboard an oceanographic vessel with a turnaround time from water collection to sequence results and annotation of ~48 hr. Identifying vertebrates by amplifying eDNA from seawater provides a novel approach for sampling and detecting the presence of elusive species of conservation importance in remote locations.
