TITLE: Fast Science and Sluggish Policy: The Herculean Task of Regulating Biodiscovery
AUTHOR: ['Rachel Wynberg', 'Sarah A Laird']
ABSTRACT:
New rules for access and benefit sharing (ABS) of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge have been established by the Nagoya Protocol but have not kept up with rapid scientific and technological advances in biodiscovery. This suggests the need for innovative, transdisciplinary approaches to regulate ABS and emerging technologies.
