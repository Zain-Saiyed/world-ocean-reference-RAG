AUTHOR: ['Tina N. Molodtsova', 'Dennis M. Opresko']
ABSTRACT:
The antipatharian fauna of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone is discussed. Five species of black corals from three genera were identified in collections from this area, including one new species. A list is provided of the 15 species of antipatharians that have been collected at depths greater than 3000 m, and a figure is included that shows the bathymetric distribution of all genera in the order. A new genus, Alternatipathes, in the family Schizopathidae is also described herein.
