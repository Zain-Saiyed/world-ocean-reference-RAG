TITLE: Emergent planning for South Africa's blue economy: Evidence from coastal and marine tourism
AUTHOR: ['Christian M. Rogerson', 'Jayne M. Rogerson']
ABSTRACT:
Ocean-based industries are in focus in terms of expanding debates and planning around the blue economy. Against this backdrop the objective in this paper is to examine contemporary directions in South Africa concerning planning for the blue economy as a whole and more specifically for the sector of coastal and marine tourism. Using documentary analysis of official planning and strategic documents, South Africa’s blue economy strategy, which is titled ‘Operation Phakisa’, is unpacked and critiqued. Attention shifts to examine current directions and challenges of unfolding planning for the expanded development of coastal and marine tourism in South Africa. It is shown that uneven spatial development characterises the existing coastal tourism economy. Arguably, tourism planning is linked to Operation Phakisa which is being challenged for a number of shortcomings, most importantly for prioritising investment attraction and economic growth stimulation over issues about the conservation of maritime resources.
